### About Jobly

Introducing Jobly, a highly-efficient web-app that revolutionizes the job search process by seamlessly organizing and tracking job postings, interviews, and all other essential information for job seekers. With its user-friendly interface, Jobly allows users to add, view, and manage multiple job postings, while providing comprehensive details such as pay, position, location and much more. Moreover, users can create and add notes that can be easily copied and utilized as needed.

I created Jobly with the aim to empower job seekers by streamlining their job search process. While there are several applications available to facilitate hiring for HR personnel, there is a dire need for a tool that can cater to the job seeker's needs, and Jobly fulfills that purpose. This application helps users avoid making mistakes and make informed decisions about their job choices.

Jobly also serves as a testament to my expertise in designing and building fully functional, responsive front-end applications using React and Typescript. It is a remarkable portfolio piece that showcases my proficiency in using React and ability to design and build user-friendly and visually appealing applications.

### Design & Development

To build Jobly, I began by designing it in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/2mOdou4dPImG5xje64agpX/Jobly?node-id=122%3A10&t=TOylIPuOIxNwRVC3-1), utilizing my UI/UX design [skills](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/DZUJWASR2WSS?utm_campaign=sharing_cta&utm_content=cert_image&utm_medium=certificate&utm_product=prof&utm_source=link).

Next, I had to carefully consider the best backend solution for my project. As I am not experienced in building backends myself, I opted to use a BaaS (Backend as a Service). After thorough research and consideration, I ultimately chose [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) due to its widespread popularity, comprehensive documentation, and user-friendly interface. Firebase provided all the necessary features, such as Authentication and Database, with a simple SDK, making it a perfect fit for my project.

For the [React](https://reactjs.org/) framework, I chose [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) for its impressive speed, built-in pre-rendering options like SG (Static Generation), image optimization, and much more. To ensure the highest level of quality, I chose to use [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), as it reduces errors and standardizes the codebase, making it easier to maintain as the project grows.

To style the app, I utilized [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) modules for each component to avoid class name collisions, as the app became increasingly complex. For animations, I integrated [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) to achieve a polished and visually appealing user experience. Throughout the development process, I meticulously adhered to best coding practices, including SOLID principles, and version control using [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
